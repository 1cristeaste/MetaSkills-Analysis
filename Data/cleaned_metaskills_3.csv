It was mainly because I relied on a tutor to teach me as my school didn't let me attend math class as I opted for Computer Science instead and I could only have one or the other. I realized by relying on a 3rd person I become vulnerable. It was the worst feeling of my life! And I just wanted it to end. Over the next few hours, I tried studying but then simply gave up thinking does it even matter anymore. But somehow I pulled together some motivation about how if I don't pass this course UofT will revoke its offer of admission. I got to work and didn't even sleep the night before the final. I gave up studying around 4 hours before the final knowing I had only learned enough to help me pass and not succeed at this class. And I don't want to experience that or put my self through those emotions ever again. ",Trying to pull myself together and focusing on what matters.

Adjusting to the way things are taught at UofT has been pretty rough as well. I sometimes feel like professors don't care and the TA's as well. There is no student-teacher connection between a prof and student here. It is like you're left high and dry on your own to figure everything out. And sometimes I wonder why do I pay a ridiculous amount of money just to listen to some person say things I already know or can find from a quick google search. There is no experiential learning so far. There is no connection between the students and the course. It just all about textbook learning and giving exams. I feel like in the next four years I am gonna walk out of UofT financially drained, with a degree in my hand who's per sq foot price is higher than that of an apartment in downtown Manhattan - while learned almost nothing. This is my biggest troubled thought right now. I don't want this to be a reality for me.
