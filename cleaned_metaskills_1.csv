I can easily remember and prioritize the points I need.,"I could take a break between my work times and learn to not do marathons as much, even though I’m in the zone of learning",Introducing learning management techniques like Pomodoro technique and Feynman techniques would be helpful since this goes towards helping students learn. The repetition aspect mentioned was really helpful. These study tips are ones I personally use. ,Mostly Agree,1.4240000000000002,217.803,218.755,15.0,"Past midterms,Prepare exercises on PCRS,Perform exercises on PCRS,Videos on PCRS,Piazza discussion board,Working with other students,Office Hours,Worksheets from Rehearse/Lecture",,"Past midterms: this helps me gauge what type of questions I may encounter and how I may answer them. 

Prepare/Perform Exercises on PCRS: these help me solidify uncertainties in my learning as I’m able to go back to them whenever I need.

Videos on PCRS: Helpful with understanding “how” something works the way it works.

Piazza Discussion Board: Helpful to learn from others and help me learn when I teach them.

Working with Other Students: Super helpful as I can gain feedback and teamwork at once, without waiting for replies as things in real-life operate differently than on discussion boards. Helps navigate nuances of learning more efficiently and shortens time taken while learning alone. Have many questions and uncertainties answered at once and adapt to real life.

Office Hours: usually my favourite and my go-to for any burning questions or assignment related stuff. Helpful for debugging and learning the true application of programming logic and concepts in real life. Again, just as helpful if not more helpful than working with other students. On-demand learning is best as I can easily adapt my thinking patterns based on feedback and learn how to think programmatically without getting answers from online or going through the frustrating process of not having people understand my code issues from discussion boards.


Worksheets: great for learning a new topic and practicing it right then and there. Good for developing neural pathways to remember the concepts and help with logic, programming, and tests.","I personally like office hours, working with others, worksheets, and doing the PCRS Prepare/Perform exercises as I’m more hands-on type of learner and coding is very hands-on. I would also add that I should write things down or draw out a problem when I’m stuck to help me visualize the questions better (which I don’t do enough). These resources will help me learn to be proactive in seeking help and not being afraid to fail. It forces me to think about how I think and apply that to questions. ","I will practice the worksheets, PCRS Prepare/Perform exercises, and go to office hours for help. They definitely help with my understanding. I will also ask questions on Discussion Board if I need (but only if I’ve a specific question). I will start doing so the week of Jan 27 to prepare in advance. I will go to Gerstein, at home, or go to Sid Smith cafe with friends as studying with friends helps my concentration (keeps me accountable). I will study for between 30 mins - 1 hour if necessary for each topic, starting from reviewing week 1 material all the way to the material before the exam.",4.359,771.209,877.2919999999999,69.0,Good. ,I can hold myself accountable by writing down my plans.,My life or other priorities such as exams before this exam may interfere with my study plans so I need to be flexible in knowing what to expect and what I should prioritize. ,I would like this to help with overall preparation for any exam.

But those that learn from their mistakes always grow compared to those who don't. Learning where you make your mistakes teaches you not only how to avoid them, more importantly it teaches you why you made it. A Fixed Mindset limits your ability to learn new concepts. How do you expect to learn new math skills if you don't make a few mistakes along the way? With a Growth Mindset, you are never thinking about mistakes and instead are eager to learn which takes the stress off of making a mistake. Some stress can be good to get your brain to work harder, but stress constantly from making a mistake is unhealthy for your brain and can damage it. The goal to learn should not be about marks, it should be about mastering the topic at hand. We live in a society that deems marks as the ultimate result to demonstrate the performance of a student, but their are limitations to this. Majority of students just want the marks so they study a type of problem and when a similar problem is on the exam, they know how to approach it. However, if they were asked to solve it again after some time, they don't recall it because they were blindly memorizing the steps to the solution, they didn't really know how to solve it. So the Fixed Mindset may help you pass some obstacles in your way and increase your self-esteem, however, the Growth Mindset is more healthier for your brain, you will master the topic you learn, and you will never have to worry that you weren't smart enough, rather you are continuing to achieve the status of mastering the topic.",8.621,1362.9920000000002,1366.108,60.0,5.612,5.612,10.329,1.0,2.27,7.735,10.895,3.0,"Always put in hard work and practice. There is no harm in practicing really hard for something that you want to learn. Hard work and practice is not only about how many times you read the textbooks and did the questions. It also means did you really want to learn the material or did you just want to memorize it and use it for the exam. Never stop practicing hard questions. The reason these questions are hard is because you haven't mastered them like addition and subtraction yet. Even these topics at first took you probably a very long time, but then you got the hang of it and now you can probably do them faster than a calculator. Finally, asking questions is crucial to your growth. People with the Growth Mindset do well in the long term because they ask so many questions. I know many teachers who used to call out a student in my high school because he/she asked a ""dumb"" question. The student will feel insulted and will stop learning right there. No new questions are fueling their curiosity and their knowledge will not grow.","I remember my first year at University of Toronto, and I was told to get very high marks. All I ever cared about was did I get 100% on every assignment and exam. Ironically, my GPA from high school went from a 4.0 to almost a 1.6. I understand that many say high school was easy, but when I used to go to school I was always eager to learn. I never cared about marks as long as they weren't below 90%. If I got a test back below 90%, I would highlight my mistakes to prevent from making the same again. I have used the Growth Mindset in high school and I did amazing. When I switched to the Fixed Mindset, I didn't learn more than what I needed to know and right now I can't even remember how to answer some questions from many of my other courses. This year I am doing amazing again because there is no stress to get marks, just to learn, and I continue to challenge myself.

First, let me tell you that you ARE enough. I can relate to how you are feeling about school right now. I want you to know that you are uniquely YOU and you bring value to this world that no one else can. 
This is just a temporary roadblock within our minds that we need to discuss and come to terms with. What we have is called a Fixed Mindset - when we make mistakes we feel stupid and try to avoid harder problems that we feel we can't solve, we especially avoid challenging problems when working around people who we feel are smarter than us because we believe it will make us 'look stupid'. What we fail to see when we are so caught up in the moment is that our mindset is what determines how we feel and how we view and handle situations. 
What's very important when you have a Fixed Mindset is to see your situation in a new like by adopting a growth mindset. Instead of avoiding our mistakes we must look at them carefully because it will make us smarter. Instead of getting discouraged when faced with challenges because we think we are bad at it, we must spend time to figure out what we do not understand. Be curious and do your research, have a thirst for knowledge and spend time learning about your passion, you can get there. I know you can. All it takes is little steps every day.

People with a fixed mindset believe that they are born with a certain level of knowledge and skills and that they are limited by their natural essence. They do not believe that they can grow in different areas of their life through effort and practice. They end up avoiding challenging situations and not putting in the work that is needed to learn and grow. Furthermore, they sabotage their own growth by their own thinking--this is especially obvious when they make mistakes. Rather than learning from their mistakes, they get frustrated and give up because they believe that they have a fixed brain and that they will never learn. Science, on the other hand, has shown that everyone's brain reacts to learning and challenging situations by growing. People with a growth mindset believe in this scientific knowledge that we have the power to grow through deliberate effort and by making mistakes. People with a growth mindset truly believe in their ability to grow and so when they make mistakes, they do not get frustrated--rather, they use those experiences to see what they can learn from it. Furthermore, they are more willing to step outside their comfort zone and seek out more difficult challenges, rather than staying within their comfort zone all the time or doing nothing to grow. Finally, and very importantly, people with a growth mindset are not ashamed to ask for help when they need to. They do not feel embarrassed or shy about their inability to solve problems because they believe that they can grow and overcome those challenges if given the right support and guidance. People with a fixed mindset, on the other hand, will be too embarrassed to ask for help, because of their belief that they possess a fixed set of knowledge and skills that will never increase and that they will expose their lack of knowledge if they ask for help.

One of the things that I am still working on, however, is trying to adopt alternative learning strategies. Sometimes the best approach to learning is the hard approach, e.g., practicing rewriting our lecture notes in our own words without the aid of any resources, sketching diagrams by hand to explain difficult concepts, and so on. I am working hard to remove bad study habits from my routine so that my study sessions are more effective.

I like how the article broke down the approach to learning using the ""formula for growing your brain: effort + good strategies + help from others = brain growth"". I think this is a wonderful formula! Thank you for sharing this with us.","I think learning math at university has been such a huge challenge in the first year and has really been testing my belief in having a growth mindset. In the first semester especially, I avoided group work and office hours because I always felt underprepared to talk to people about my problems. However, I have changed this semester and am constantly going to office hours and finding study partners so that I have someone to talk to about math and to bounce off ideas. I am continuing to strive and constantly asking for help and advice from profs and senior students about their learning strategies. I am trying to look at math problems from a fresh perspective and developing new habits for doing math rather than continuing old habits picked up from high school. I am trying to practice alternative proof strategies for solving math problems rather than sticking to certain strategies just because they seem easier to me, and constantly making effort to learn new definitions/theorems.

I think if I persist in having the growth mindset and if I keep at it in terms of (i) making the effort; (ii) adopting new and effective learning strategies; and (iii) seeking out help whenever I need it; then I will start seeing positive results soon.

I feel like I sometimes have a Fixed and sometimes a Growth Mindset. It might depend on my mood or on the subject itself.

This is because with a fixed mindset you're less likely to try harder problems and instead stick to the easier ones so as not to fail as you're afraid of feeling stupid if you get an answer wrong. With a fixed mindset, getting a wrong answer can be very discouraging and automatically make you feel like you're bad at the subject you're working on, and that you'll never be good at it. However, by not trying the more challenging questions, you're not putting yourself in a position to learn more and grow or develop new skills for how to go about solving those more challenging problems. But having a growth mindset allows you to take on those more challenging problems with a more open and positive outlook because you know that not getting the right answer to a question doesn't make you stupid, it simply shows you that there is more to be learnt and even gives you the questions that might need to be asked in order to succeed.

Instead of feeling like these concepts being hard for you is a sign of your lack of intelligence, think of your desire to fix them as a sign of your curiosity. I recently learned that the brain is very malleable - it has the capacity to grow quite a bit, for new connections and pathways to be made. But in order to generate these pathways and grow the brain, we have to repeatedly work at things that challenge us. For example, I struggled with Arabic for years until I went to Jordan. Before I went to Jordan, I was afraid to practice speaking because I was afraid of being embarrassed because I would make a lot of mistakes and others would see. In Jordan, every day was forced to practice speaking. I got used to being wrong and didn't take it so personally. Now I can have full conversations with Arabic speakers and my learning is accelerating exponentially because I'm not so hard on myself when I make mistakes - I do not shy away from them anymore because I understand they are part of the learning process.",13.92,254.66,322.21,7.0,0.0,0.0,40.126999999999995,0.0,18.218,25.759,26.607,4.0,"I definitely can use it when writing essays, which I find to be the most challenging part of university. When I write, I get bogged down with sounding unintelligent or inelegant. But I think if I tried more to do a ""free write,"" that is to say, a chunk of writing where I didn't edit myself after every few words, I could work more efficiently. It also would make sitting down to essay-write less daunting, which usually causes procrastination; I want to avoid doing the thing that is unpleasant for me and which makes me feel dumb. This would free up more time for a second draft, some time to edit, and really think about what I want to say, rather than leaving it to the last minute. ","At one point, I was so worried about seeming bad at Arabic in class that I stopped going to class. I did very poorly that semester because I wasn't getting the fours hours of practice/week with my peers. If I had responded to this learning process with the Growth Mindset, I would have gone to class because I wouldn't have been afraid. I would have been reminded that everyone was struggling around me, that struggling is a part of growth, and I would have done better in the class.

If someone has a negative self-image and a lot of feelings of shame, it is difficult for them to convince themselves they are inherently good and their mistakes are not shameful. Perhaps for these people, they might spend more time working on exercises and doing things that help them find tenderness towards themselves.","I don't know how an activity like this could help me to improve my own self-image, but I think a lot of people struggle with this problem in university and if we could do more to help people feel good about themselves it could help with their academic performance and mental health.",Strongly Agree,4.09,286.272,288.694,5.0,Mostly Agree,,4.992,6.711,9.429,2.0,3.9560000000000004,4.945,7.077999999999999,2.0,,no,yes,no,no,no,no,yes,no,yes,yes,yes,no,,toacknowledgexamisdone,no,no,,no
